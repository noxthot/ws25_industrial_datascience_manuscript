# Exploratory Data Analysis {#sec-act1}

In this section we will explore the concept of predictive maintenance using a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry.

You can download the dataset @ai4i2020 at [this link](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5HS5C).

Here is a summary of the variables present in the dataset:

::: {.callout-note}
Unfortunately the documentation neither provides details on the type of machine that is simulated nor the product it is thought to produce.
For the sake of imagination, we will think of a very simple milling machine that produces parts in three quality variants: low, medium, and high.
:::

The table shows various error types and our task is to gain insights on when they occur.

::: {.callout-note}
This is a warmup task with a polished, synthetic dataset and luckily we are provided with a description of the nature of the different failures.
