The goal of clustering is to group similar time series together based on their characteristics or patterns.

But what does **similar** mean in the context of time series data?
Defining **similarity** is not straight forward due to the inherent subjectivity involved.

Difficulties are:
- *Context-Dependent*: Similarity can vary based on the specific application or domain.
- *Human Bias*: Metrics are often chosen based on human intuition, which can introduce bias.
- *Inconsistent Interpretations*: Different experts may have different perspectives on what constitutes similarity.
- *Parameter Sensitivity*: Many similarity measures come with tunable parameters that can significantly affect the results.


## Clustering algorithms {#sec-act3-cluster-algorithms}
Time series clustering algorithms can be broadly categorized into four main types:
- **Distance-Based**: These algorithms rely on a distance measure to quantify the similarity between time series. Examples include k-means and k-median.
- **Distribution-Based**: These methods model the distribution (in a very general sense) of the time series data and cluster based on statistical properties or descriptive features that represent the characteristics of the time series. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and DBSCAN.
- **Subsequence-Based**: These algorithms focus on clustering representative subsequences of time series data rather than the entire series. Examples include methods based on shapelets and sliding windows.
- **Representation-Learning-Based**: These methods use techniques like autoencoders or recurrent neural networks to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the time series data, which is then clustered using traditional clustering algorithms.

@paparrizos2024 gives a good overview of different time series clustering methods.

In the following, we will briefly introduce distance-based clustering using two common similarity measures: Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
