## Still under construction

This section is still under construction and will be completed in the near future.
Please do not go beyond this point for now.
:::

In this session, we will revisit @sec-act3-eda and continue where we left off, trying to improve the process.

The findings in @sec-act3-eda-summary were not sufficient to explain all defects, but we found a correlation between elevated pressure during the epoxy application step and excessive epoxy application (`NOK_1`).
Regarding the uneven distribution of applied epoxy (`NOK_4`), the operators provided the information, that they suspect that this is caused by an insufficiently cleaned nozzle.
The cleaning process happens at the end of the previous processing step, where the nozzle moves away from the product and blows out residual epoxy.

## Investigating the blow out step
::::
Investigate the pressure during the blow out step (process step index 3 of previous iteration) and see if you can find a correlation to `NOK_4` defects.
:::

Having more information about `NOK_1` and `NOK_4`, we can now try to finetune the machine's parameters to reduce the number of defects.

## Finetuning the machine parameters
::::
The accompanying `Readme.md` file contains information on how to run the machine again with different parameters.
Try to improve the parameters to reduce the number of defects.
Keep `night` shift and `NUM_PIECES` at the default values.

You experience new issues or want to further finetune the parameters?
Feel free to have a look at the new `csv` files that the machine is producing.

_Hint: The process is stochastic, so you can not expect to get rid of every single defect._

How do the results of the new parameters compare to the original ones?

The original data set had 5000 pieces with the following distribution:

| Error Code | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| OK         | 4662  | 93.24%     |
| NOK_1      |   62  |  1.24%     |
| NOK_2      |    1  |  0.02%     |
| NOK_3      |   10  |  0.20%     |
| NOK_4      |  265  |  5.30%     |

Great job? Everything looks good on the night shift?

## Try the machine on day shift
::::
Run the machine again with your parameters, but this time during `day` shift.

How do the results of the new parameters compare to the ones from the night shift?

Investigate the root cause of this difference by looking at the produced `csv` files.

## Finetune the parameters to work well for both shifts
::::
The machine is not only telling you a defect summary, but also the duration it took to produce the parts.
Try to finetune the parameters to achieve a good compromise between quality (few defects) and speed (short duration).

_Hints:_

- _The machine's temperature depends on the ambient temperature, the processing speed and the pressure settings._
- _The duration it takes to produce knifes is determined by the processing speed._
