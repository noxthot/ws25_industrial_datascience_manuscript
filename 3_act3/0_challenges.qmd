Real machine data is often messy and requires substantial preprocessing before it can be used for analysis.
Challenges from a data engineering perspective that often arise include:
- (Temporary) sensor failures
- Data gaps due to communication issues or buffer overflows
- Incomplete data
- Datatype inconsistencies
- Lack of documentation
- High data volume

Once data is collected and transformed, additional challenges may arise during analysis:
- Noisy or inconsistent measurements
- Outliers or anomalies in the data
- Variability in operating conditions
- There may be variables that are not captured in the data but still relevant for the process
- Complex relationships between variables
- Lack of labeled data for supervised learning
- Highly imbalanced data sets
- Data privacy concerns

Until now, we have primarily focused on static analysis of historical data.

However, many industrial applications require real-time data processing and analysis to enable timely decision-making and process optimization.
Complexity increases significantly in real-time scenarios due to the need for low-latency processing, the handling of streaming data, and possibly the integration of data from multiple sources.
