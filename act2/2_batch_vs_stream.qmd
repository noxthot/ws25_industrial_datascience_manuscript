# Batch vs Stream Processing

|                    | **Batch Processing**                                                   | **Stream Processing**                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Processes datasets in periodic chunks                                  | Continuously processes data arriving in a stream                  |
| **Latency**        | High                                                                   | Low                                                               |
| **Context**        | Full data available; supports complex operations                       | Limited view (single event or window)                             |
| **Typical Use**    | Historical analyses, model training, reporting, ETL                    | Real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, decision-making          |
| **ETL**            | Collects data over a given period, performs transformations on the entire dataset, and loads it into a target system, such as a data warehouse, all at once. | Continuously ingests and processes data as it arrives, applies transformations on the fly, and loads the processed data into a target system incrementally. | 

The time to insight is the most critical differentiator between batch and stream processing.
Batch processing is best-suited for less time-sensitive tasks, such as end-of-day reports, historical data-analysis or model training.
In contrast, stream processing is designed for scenarios where immediate insights and actions are crucial, such as real-time optimization of production processes.

Batch processing tends to be less complex to manage because it operates on static datasets and follows a defined schedule, making it easier to plan and allocate resources.
It is well-suited for scenarios where data consistency and completeness are more important than immediacy.

Stream processing, on the other hand, requires handling continuous data flows, which can introduce additional complexity in terms of system architecture, data consistency, and fault tolerance.
Addressing these challenges necessitates a higher level of skill and expertise and might need specialized IT infrastructure.
