Time series classification belongs to the class of supervised learning and is defined as the task of assigning a label to a time series.

Again, this is a very active research area and many different methods have been proposed.
For a good overview, check e.g. @{faouzi2024}, which divide time series classification methods into the following categories:

- **Metric**: Distance-based methods, e.g. nearest neighbor classifiers with different distance measures.
- **Kernels**: Methods that use kernel functions to measure similarity between time series.
- **Shapelets**: Methods that learn discriminative subsequences (shapelets).
- **Tree-based**: Methods that use decision trees or random forests.
- **Bag-of-Words**: Methods that represent time series as a "bag of words".
- **Image**: Methods that treat time series as images.
- **Deep Learning**: Methods that use deep learning architectures.
- **Random Convolutions**: Methods that use random convolutional filters.
- **Ensemble**: Methods that combine multiple classifiers for improved performance.

We can see that many of these categories already appeared in @{sec-act2-cluster-algorithms}.

A simple metric-based (distance-based) baseline method for time series classification is to use a nearest neighbor classifier with a suitable distance measure for time series, e.g. dynamic time warping (DTW).
This is implemented in `sktime` as [`KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier`](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.classification.distance_based.KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier.html) or [`KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifierTslearn`](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.classification.distance_based.KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifierTslearn.html) (latter is just a wrapper for the implementation in `tslearn`).
These classifiers work similar to the `KNeighborsClassifier` for tabular data from `sklearn`, but use a distance measure suitable for time series.
We have learned about `euclidean` distance and `DTW` in @{sec-act2-cluster-similaritymeasures}.

In this section we will have a brief look at time series forests (tree-based) in the context of time series classification.
